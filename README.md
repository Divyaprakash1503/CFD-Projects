 # Lid-Driven Cavity #Development of C code for solving the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for the lid-driven cavity problem at two different Reynolds numbers, 100 and 400. #Discretization: #The problem was discretized using the finite difference method with specified boundary conditions on a 100×100 grid.
